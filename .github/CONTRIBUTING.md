## Pull Request Process
1. **Add tests** if new functionality is added or if it affects the system.
2. **Update the README.md and Wiki** with details of changes to the interface, this includes new methods, 
   exposed functions and classes, useful file locations, etc....
3. **Increase the version numbers** in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. We automate this using [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Where to start?

Unsure where to begin contributing to Loggin'JS? 

You can start by looking through these **help-wanted** issues: 
- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/loggin-js/loggin-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner-friendly) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, a test or two, or some docs changes. 
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/loggin-js/loggin-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. 

Or take a look at the code :)  
It all starts [here][src], check [`src/node.js`][src:node].

## Workings

Loggin'JS works both in **NodeJS** and the **browser**, although the browser version is still beeing worked on (_help is welcomed_).  
This is important because the project has 2 main files:  
  * one for **node**: [`src/node.js`][src:node] 
  * one for the **browser**: [`src/browser.js`][src:browser]

This was done to be able to export different sets of [Notifiers] and other stuff that might need to be different for the browser or for node. 

One other **important** thing to take into account is that there is some sort of **"Plugin"** thingy going on.  
Can be checked in the files mentioned above.


## Versioning

We use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to manage releasing and CHANGELOG generation (with semver and [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)) using [@conventional-changelog/standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).
